{order.products?.reduce((acc, item) => acc + item.quantity, 0)}
ðŸŽ¯ Goal:
To calculate the total quantity of products in a single order.

ðŸ§  What is .reduce()?
The .reduce() method loops over an array and accumulates a single return value by applying a function to each element.

ðŸ§© Breakdown of the code:
order.products?.reduce(...)
order.products is an array of products in a single order.

The optional chaining (?.) ensures that if products is undefined or null, it doesn't crash â€” it will just return undefined.

(acc, item) => acc + item.quantity
This is the callback function used by reduce.

acc â†’ the accumulator (starts at 0, then stores the running total).

item â†’ the current product object in the loop.

item.quantity â†’ the quantity of the current product.

acc + item.quantity â†’ adds the current quantity to the total so far.

0 â†’ the initial value of the accumulator.
