               ------------ CSS transition -----------------
CSS transitions allows you to change property values smoothly, over a given duration.

properities
transition-delay
transition-duration
transition-property
transition-timing-function


transition-timing-function:
ease - specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
linear - specifies a transition effect with the same speed from start to end
ease-in - specifies a transition effect with a slow start
ease-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow end
ease-in-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow start and end
cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function

                ------------ Transform--------------------
CSS transforms allow you to move, rotate, scale, and skew elements.
translate()
rotate()
scaleX()
scaleY()
scale()
skewX()
skewY()
skew()
matrix()

1-translate() method moves an element from its current position (according to the parameters given for the X-axis and the Y-axis).
2-rotate() method rotates an element clockwise or counter-clockwise according to a given degree.
3-scale() method increases or decreases the size of an element (according to the parameters given for the width and height).
4-scaleX() method increases or decreases the width of an element.
5-scaleY() method increases or decreases the height of an element.
6-skewX() method skews an element along the X-axis by the given angle.
7-skewY() method skews an element along the Y-axis by the given angle.
8-skew() method skews an element along the X and Y-axis by the given angles.
9-matrix() method combines all the 2D transform methods into one.
  matrix(scaleX(), skewY(), skewX(), scaleY(), translateX(), translateY())
